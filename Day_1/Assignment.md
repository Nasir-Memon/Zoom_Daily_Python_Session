#### **Exercise 2: Print Odd Numbers**
Write a program that prints all odd numbers from 1 to 100.

```python
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 3: Factorial Calculation**
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number provided by the user. Use a `while` loop for this task.

**Example:**
- Input: `5`
- Output: `Factorial of 5 is 120`

```python
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 4: Multiplication Table**
Write a program that generates a multiplication table for a number provided by the user. Use a `for` loop.

**Example:**
- Input: `3`
- Output:
```
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
...
3 x 10 = 30
```

```python
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 5: User Input Loop**
Create a program that continuously asks the user to enter numbers. When the user types "stop," the program should print the total of all entered numbers.

**Example:**
```
Enter a number (or type 'stop' to end): 5
Enter a number (or type 'stop' to end): 10
Enter a number (or type 'stop' to end): stop
Total: 15
```

```python
# Your code here
```

#### **Exercise 6: Pattern Printing**
Write a program that prints the following pattern using nested loops:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

```python
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 7: Guess the Number Game**
Create a simple number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 20. The user has to guess the number, with hints provided (too high, too low).

**Example:**
```
Guess a number between 1 and 20: 15
Too high!
Guess a number between 1 and 20: 10
Too low!
Guess a number between 1 and 20: 12
Congratulations! You guessed it!
```

```python
# Your code here
```

#### **Exercise 8: Count Down**
Write a program that counts down from 10 to 1 and then prints "Blast off!".

```python
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 9: Fibonacci Series**
Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to the nth term, where n is provided by the user.

```python
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 10: Reverse a String**
Write a program that takes a string from the user and prints it in reverse using a loop.

```python
# Your code here
```
